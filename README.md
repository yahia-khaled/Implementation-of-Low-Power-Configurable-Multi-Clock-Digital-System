RTL to GDS Implementation of Low Power Configurable Multi-Clock Digital System
This repository showcases my final project from a comprehensive course in digital design and ASIC flow, where I gained in-depth knowledge and practical experience in various advanced topics. Key areas of expertise include:

RTL Coding with Verilog: Developed efficient and scalable RTL code for digital systems.
Advanced Verilog Testbenches: Implemented sophisticated self-checking testbenches to ensure design correctness.
TCL Scripting: Automated design flow processes using TCL scripting.
Static Timing Analysis: Analyzed and optimized timing across the design to meet performance requirements.
Low Power Design Techniques: Applied strategies to minimize power consumption in digital designs.
Clock Domain Crossing (CDC & RDC): Addressed challenges in crossing different clock domains to ensure data integrity.
RTL Synthesis: Translated RTL code to gate-level netlists using Design Compiler.
Design for Testing (DFT) Insertion: Integrated DFT features to enhance testability of the design.
Formal Verification: Verified design correctness post-synthesis, post-DFT, and post-place-and-route (PnR).
ASIC Flow: Gained hands-on experience with ASIC design flow, including floorplanning, pin placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, timing closure, chip finishing, and sign-off.
Post-Layout Verification: Performed gate-level simulations to validate the final design.
Project Overview:
In this project, I designed a Low Power Configurable Multi-Clock Digital System that interacts through a UART receiver. The system processes commands, performs operations such as register file reading/writing and ALU-based processing, and transmits the results back using a 4-byte frame through the UART transmitter. The project showcases the complete flow from RTL coding to GDSII, demonstrating proficiency in low-power design, clock domain crossing, and ASIC flow.
